# ðŸ’°ExpenseBuddy - Expense Tracker Application
ExpenseBuddy is a web-based application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that helps users manage their expenses effectively. Users can register, log in, add, edit, delete, and view their expenses. It also provides data visualization for better analysis of spending patterns.


# ExpenseBuddy allows users to:

1. Register and log in to their account.
2. Add new expenses, edit or delete existing ones.
3. View all their expenses in a list.
4. Track total expenses and filter them by category.
5. Visualize expenses in charts and graphs to make informed financial decisions.

   
This app uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for user authentication and MongoDB to store user data and expenses securely.
